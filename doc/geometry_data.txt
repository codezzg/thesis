The UDP geometry data is sent by the server in packets of cfg::PACKET_SIZE_BYTES bytes.

This data contains information on how to update the current client-local data, hence they're
also referred to as "Update Packets".

An Update Packet has the following format:

[header|chunk0.header|chunk0.payload|chunk1.header|chunk1.payload|...]

There may be unused bytes at the end of the packet depending on the combined size of the chunks.
Detailed content of the individual sections (Header and ChunkHeader) can be found in common/udp_messages.hpp

An Update Packet is therefore a list of individual updates, each represented by a Chunk.
A ChunkHeader contains the following information:
	- the ID of the model this chunk refers to
	- the type of update (vertex / index)
	- the starting vertex/index to be updated
	- the amount of vertices/indices to update

So, a ChunkHeader like:
	[A | Vertex | 42 | 367]

will mean that model A's vertices from 42 to (367+42 = 409) must be updated with the ones contained
in the payload.
This chunk's payload will have a size of [ sizeof(Vertex) * 367 ] bytes.
